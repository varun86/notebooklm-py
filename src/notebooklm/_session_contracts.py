"""Type-only contracts shared across feature APIs.

This module defines the narrow structural Protocols feature APIs depend
on. Per ADR-013, a Protocol lives here only when **shared by ≥2
features**; single-consumer capabilities (e.g. chat's ``transport_post``
+ ``next_reqid``, artifact polling's ``register_drain_hook``) stay
local to their owning feature module.

Contents:

* :class:`AuthMetadata` and :class:`Kernel` — selected-account routing
  metadata + pure transport surface consumed by the upload pipeline.
* :class:`RpcCaller`, :class:`LoopGuard`, :class:`OperationScopeProvider`,
  :class:`AsyncWorkRuntime` — the four shared capability Protocols
  promoted in Phase 1 of the capability refactor.

The broad ``Session`` Protocol that previously bundled all of these
together was deleted in Phase 7 (refactor.md §Migration Plan step 10).
Feature APIs that need more than one capability either compose the
shared Protocols here or define a feature-local runtime in their own
module (``ChatRuntime`` in ``_chat.py``, ``ArtifactsRuntime`` in
``_artifacts.py``, ``UploadRuntime`` in ``_source_upload.py``). The
standalone ``DrainHookRegistration`` Protocol that lived here in the
broad-``Session`` era was deleted in the same step; the canonical
``DrainHookRegistration`` is now the local one in ``_artifacts.py``.
