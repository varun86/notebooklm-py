"""Construction-time helpers extracted from :class:`Session.__init__`.

Mechanical decomposition of ``Session.__init__`` (``docs/improvement.md``
§3.1) into three concerns:
:func:`validate_constructor_args` (kwarg validation + normalization),
:func:`build_collaborators` (the 8 collaborators in dependency order),
and :func:`wire_middleware_chain` (the seven-middleware ADR-009 chain).
Behavior is bit-for-bit identical to the pre-extraction ``__init__``;
dependency-ordering and seam-resolution comments are preserved verbatim
inside the helpers so future readers see *why* the order matters.

Builds on the constructor-DI work in #1027 (``36dcc634`` —
"refactor(session): constructor DI for late-bound test seams; drop
http_client.setter"), which eliminated the late-binding wrappers and
the ``Kernel.http_client.setter`` and made ``decode_response`` /
``sleep`` / ``is_auth_error`` / ``async_client_factory`` the canonical
injection seams.

**Seam-resolution boundary**: ``None``-default resolution for ``sleep``
(→ ``asyncio.sleep``) and ``async_client_factory`` (→
``httpx.AsyncClient``) MUST stay in :mod:`notebooklm._session` so the
documented monkeypatch paths ``notebooklm._session.asyncio.sleep`` and
``notebooklm._session.httpx.AsyncClient`` keep steering the seam at
construction time. The helpers here accept already-resolved seam
callables; the caller (``Session.__init__``) owns the
``X if X is not None else <module-attr>`` dance against its own bindings.

    (rather than a frozen reference) preserves the pre-extraction

    The ``snapshot_provider`` closure captures ``host`` so the transport
