"""Idempotency layer for mutating-RPC patterns.

This module hosts two cooperating pieces:

1. :func:`idempotent_create` — the existing per-API probe-then-retry
   wrapper for create-RPC patterns. A create RPC like
   ``NotebooksAPI.create`` or ``SourcesAPI.add_url`` is a mutating POST:
   the *server may have committed the write* even if the client sees a
   5xx or network error. Naive retries duplicate the resource; the
   wrapper inverts the direction: run with internal-retries disabled,
   then probe for a server-side commit before re-issuing.

2. :class:`IdempotencyRegistry` — the 6-policy classification layer that
   :class:`~notebooklm._rpc_executor.RpcExecutor` consults to compute the
   *effective* ``disable_internal_retries`` value (and, for
   ``CLIENT_TOKEN_DEDUPE`` policies, inject a fresh client-token into
   request params before encoding). The registry is a single source of
   truth that future RPCs can be classified against without touching the
   executor.

   This foundation is intentionally **behavior-neutral**: every method
   defaults to :attr:`IdempotencyPolicy.UNCLASSIFIED`, which is silent
   and reproduces today's retry behavior. The Wave-2 classification
   arc (see ADR-005, ``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``)
   replaces these placeholders RPC-by-RPC.

Per-API probes used by :func:`idempotent_create` are caller-supplied
because there is no universal probe key (notebooks: title +
baseline-diff; sources: url-match; ``add_text``: no probe possible — see
:class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.NonIdempotentRetryError`).

This module is private (``_idempotency.py``); call sites live in the
domain APIs (``_notebooks.py``, ``_sources.py``) and the RPC executor
(``_rpc_executor.py``). The canonical home for the taxonomy itself, the
six-policy axis, and the per-RPC classification rationale is
ADR-005 (``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``).

    Args:
        create: Coroutine factory that issues the create RPC. The
            underlying ``rpc_call`` MUST be invoked with
            ``disable_internal_retries=True`` so the first transport
            failure surfaces to this wrapper instead of being retried
            blindly inside ``_perform_authed_post``.
        probe: Coroutine factory that returns the resource if it
            already exists server-side, or ``None`` if not. Probes are
            API-specific (notebooks: list-then-baseline-diff by title;
            sources: list-then-url-match).
        max_attempts: Maximum total ``create()`` invocations (default
            2 — one initial + one retry). Each attempt is followed by
            a probe; the probe runs only after a transport failure.
        label: Diagnostic label embedded in log messages.

    Returns:
        The result of a successful ``create()`` call, or the value
        returned by ``probe()`` after a transient transport failure.

    Raises:
        Whatever ``create()`` raises on the final attempt if the probe
        consistently returns ``None`` and retries are exhausted. Non-
        transport exceptions (auth, validation, decoding) propagate
        from the first ``create()`` call without invoking the probe.

    Cancellation:
        Pure ``await`` — no ``asyncio.shield``. A ``CancelledError``
        propagates immediately at the next yield point so the caller
        keeps full structured-concurrency semantics.

# Mutating-RPC idempotency registry (B1 foundation — P0-3 + P1-2)
# ============================================================================
#
# The registry is the single source of truth for "how should this RPC behave
# under retry?" It is consulted by ``RpcExecutor`` at five sites to compute
# the *effective* ``disable_internal_retries`` value, and (for
# ``CLIENT_TOKEN_DEDUPE`` policies) to inject a fresh client-token into
# request params before encoding.
#
# IMPORTANT — behavior-neutral foundation:
#   This module is a foundation only. Every ``RPCMethod`` default-populates
#   to ``IdempotencyPolicy.UNCLASSIFIED`` with the Wave-2 placeholder note.
#   UNCLASSIFIED is silent (no log emission, no behavior change) and
#   resolves to ``effective_disable_internal_retries=False`` so today's
#   retries continue to fire identically. Wave 2 will classify individual
#   RPCs without changing the executor.

    the derivation and the per-policy rationale.

    Policies fall into three retry-safety bands:

      (caller has accepted at-least-once semantics; WARN logged).

    * **NOT safe to retry inside the transport**:
      :attr:`PROBE_THEN_CREATE` (callers own the probe loop; transport
      retry would race the probe), :attr:`NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY`
      (e.g. ``add_text`` — no probe key, must surface the first
      failure).

# GENERATE_MIND_MAP (P0-3) — generation RPC with no client-token slot.
# Params are ``[source_ids_nested, None, None, None, None,
# ["interactive_mindmap", [["[CONTEXT]", instructions]], language], None,
# [2, None, [1]]]`` (see ``_artifact_generation.py`` line 595-604). Every
# slot is structural (sources, content config, language, mode triple). The
# response carries the mind-map JSON directly (line 614-622 reads
# ``result[0][0]``) — there is no task_id to probe with after the fact, so
# CLIENT_TOKEN_DEDUPE is impossible here too.
#
# Note: ``GENERATE_MIND_MAP`` itself does NOT persist the note server-side
# (see ``tests/integration/test_mind_map_chain_vcr.py`` header). The actual
# persistence is the subsequent ``CREATE_NOTE`` + ``UPDATE_NOTE`` chain in
# ``NoteService.create_note`` (formerly ``_mind_map.create_note``, removed
# in Phase 6). PROBE_THEN_CREATE here suppresses the inner retry loop on
# the *generation* RPC for two reasons: (a) a blind re-POST wastes the
# expensive LLM inference, and (b) LLM nondeterminism means a retried
# generation may return a *different* mind-map JSON, which would
# silently mismatch what the client saw on the first commit before the
# response was lost. Classifying CREATE_NOTE for the persisted-write side
# of the chain is a separate follow-up (out of scope per the b-generation
# task spec, which restricts edits to ``_artifact_generation.py`` and
# ``_idempotency.py``).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wave 2 classifications (P0-3 side-effects + P1-2 notebooks)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These entries replace the UNCLASSIFIED placeholders for the five mutating
# RPCs whose side-effect semantics are well-understood and stable. The full
# audit decision matrix lives in ADR-005
# (``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``); the short version follows.
#
# DELETE_NOTEBOOK / DELETE_SOURCE / DELETE_ARTIFACT
#   Server-side delete is idempotent: replaying the request after a 5xx /
#   network failure yields the same final state (the resource is gone).
#   Classification: ``IDEMPOTENT_SET_OP``. The transport retry loop keeps
#   running unchanged — today's behavior is preserved, the registry simply
#   documents *why* it is safe.
#
# REFRESH_SOURCE
#   Refresh kicks off a server-side fetch job. A duplicate refresh job is
#   harmless (extra bandwidth, same eventual content) but observable, so
#   the caller has accepted at-least-once semantics. Classification:
#   ``AT_LEAST_ONCE_ACCEPTED``. The transport may retry; the registry
#   emits a rate-limited WARN so operators can see the trade-off when it
#   actually fires.
#
# SHARE_NOTEBOOK
#   Mutates the shared-users / public-access ACL. A blind retry after a
#   network blip can re-send invitation emails (with ``notify=True``) or
#   flip access between RESTRICTED / ANYONE-WITH-LINK twice. The codebase
#   does expose a server-side probe RPC (``GET_SHARE_STATUS``) that can
#   list the current ACL, so the *correct* policy is ``PROBE_THEN_CREATE``
#   — the transport must NOT retry blindly, and a future wrapper can
#   ``get_status()`` to decide whether the prior call landed before
#   re-issuing. Wave-2 scope is the classification (which suppresses the
#   blind retry today); the caller-side probe-then-create wrapper is a
#   follow-up.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wave 2 classifications — ADD_SOURCE + ADD_SOURCE_FILE (P0-3, P1-2)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ADD_SOURCE is variant-shaped: the call site distinguishes ``"url"`` (web /
# YouTube), ``"drive"`` (Google Drive document), and ``"text"`` (pasted
# content). Each variant has a different retry-safety profile because the
# server-side dedupe key differs:
#
# * ``"url"`` — probe by ``source.url == url`` on a notebook list. The probe
#   is a single GET_NOTEBOOK; the wrapper retries the create once if the
#   probe finds nothing. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
# * ``"drive"`` — probe by ``file_id in source.url`` (Drive URLs embed the
#   file_id). Same wrapper as ``"url"``. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
# * ``"text"`` — no reliable dedupe key (titles non-unique, body not
#   exposed in the source list). NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY: force-disable the
#   inner transport retries and let the first failure surface so the caller
#   can decide. See the ``add_text`` rationale in
#   ``tests/integration/concurrency/test_idempotency_create.py:17-19``.
#
# ADD_SOURCE_FILE is single-shape: it registers a file source by name.
# Filenames are NOT identity-bearing (two uploads of ``report.pdf`` are
# legitimately two distinct sources), so the per-API wrapper captures a
# baseline of source IDs *before* the create attempt and filters probe
# matches to "new since the create started" sources only. Ambiguous
# matches (>1 new source with the same filename) raise rather than guess.
# PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
#
# These four entries flip the executor onto the probe-then-create path
# via ``resolve_effective_disable_internal_retries`` — the per-API call
# sites in ``_source_add.py`` / ``_source_upload.py`` own the probe loop.
