"""Tests for the per-loop / per-resolved-storage-path refresh lock registry.

The module-global ``_REFRESH_LOCK = asyncio.Lock()`` was removed because
``asyncio.Lock`` binds to the first event loop that uses it, breaking on
cross-loop / cross-thread usage. The replacement mirrors the keepalive
``_get_poke_lock`` pattern: a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed on the running
loop, with per-resolved-storage-path inner locks. Cross-loop atomicity
for ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS`` is provided by the sync ``_REFRESH_STATE_LOCK``.

        """Two concurrent event loops both call ``_fetch_tokens_with_refresh``;
        AT MOST 2 subprocess invocations occur (each loop runs once at the
        worst), and crucially BOTH calls succeed without raising.

        Race model: both loops observe an auth-expiry failure, each
        capture the same pre-refresh generation, each acquire their OWN
        per-loop asyncio lock (the registry hands out distinct locks per
        loop), then race the check-and-claim under ``_REFRESH_STATE_LOCK``.

        Legacy contract (before the gated-generation fix): this test
        asserted ``run_count == 1`` because the old code bumped
        ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS`` EAGERLY pre-subprocess; the cross-loop
        loser saw the bump and skipped. That eager-bump behavior was the
        root cause of the phantom-bump failure — when the subprocess
        failed, the bump fooled concurrent waiters into skipping with
        stale storage.

        Current contract (gated-generation fix): generation is bumped
        ONLY after the subprocess succeeds. Cross-loop callers cannot
        signal "in flight" to each other (``asyncio.Future`` is
        loop-bound). In the rare
        cross-loop-concurrent-refresh case both loops may run their own
        subprocess — equivalent to two ``RotateCookies`` POSTs against
        the same storage. The end-state is correct (fresh cookies on
        disk; last writer wins, but both write the same fresh data).

        For SAME-LOOP coalescing (the dominant real-world case), the
        per-loop in-flight future ensures exactly-once subprocess
        execution; see ``tests/integration/concurrency/test_refresh_cmd_race.py``.

        To force a deterministic race in a unit test, we use a barrier at
        the point AFTER both threads have captured the generation but
