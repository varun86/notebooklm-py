"""Regression test for the offload save_cookies_to_storage off the loop.

Pre-fix: ``AuthTokens.from_storage`` and
``fetch_tokens_with_domains`` called the *synchronous*
``save_cookies_to_storage`` directly from an ``async`` context. The
function performs file I/O (atomic-replace + fsync + flock); when the
underlying storage is slow (network FS, encrypted home, fcntl
contention with a sibling process), it stalls the whole event loop.

Post-fix: each call site wraps the synchronous save with
``await asyncio.to_thread(save_cookies_to_storage, ...)``, so the
blocking work runs on the default thread executor and the event loop
keeps spinning sibling tasks.

This test monkeypatches ``notebooklm.auth.save_cookies_to_storage`` to
``time.sleep(0.5)``. While ``AuthTokens.from_storage`` is mid-save, a
concurrently scheduled async task increments a counter every 50 ms.
Pre-fix the counter is ~0–1 (loop frozen by the sync sleep); post-fix
it is >= 5 (the sleep runs on a thread, loop keeps ticking).

Why a unit-style test under ``tests/integration/concurrency/``: the
wave-3 plan places every blocking-I/O regression under this directory
even when the assertion is structural; the harness fixtures are
re-usable but not required for this surface.
