"""refresh-cmd generation race + cancel safety.

Regression test for the two failure modes at ``src/notebooklm/auth.py``:

1. **Failed refresh marked successful**:
   ``_fetch_tokens_with_refresh()`` previously bumped ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS``
   *before* awaiting ``_run_refresh_cmd()``. If the subprocess raised, the
   bump remained — concurrent waiters then observed the bumped generation
   and skipped their own refresh attempt, proceeding with stale storage.

2. **Cancellation can spawn duplicate subprocesses**:
   If the leader was cancelled while inside ``asyncio.to_thread(subprocess.run)``,
   the lock released while the subprocess kept running. A second caller could
   then acquire the lock and start a *second* subprocess against the same
   storage file.

The fix shares a per-resolved-storage-path ``asyncio.Future`` for the
in-flight refresh, shields the awaited future against caller cancellation,
and bumps the generation ONLY after the subprocess succeeds (no eager
claim). Cross-loop concurrent refreshes may both run their subprocess in
the rare race — the relaxed invariant is captured in
``tests/unit/test_refresh_lock_registry.py``
``test_two_loops_at_most_two_refreshes``.

Acceptance criteria:

    Two callers triggering refresh concurrently while ``_run_refresh_cmd``
    fails on the first; assert the second still sees a refresh attempt
    (NOT "skip because generation bumped").

This test is the red gate — it must fail on origin/main (the second caller
skips refresh because the failed first caller already bumped the
generation) and pass once the fix is applied.

    """Concurrent same-loop callers — first refresh fails, second must retry.

    The bug: caller A bumps ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS`` BEFORE running the
    subprocess. Caller B (concurrent) had already captured the
    PRE-bump generation. When B reaches the inner check-and-claim mutex,
    it observes ``current_generation != refresh_generation`` and
    short-circuits — proceeding without calling ``_run_refresh_cmd``.
    Since A's subprocess actually FAILED (storage was never refreshed),
    B then reloads stale cookies and the retry fetch fails.

    Pre-fix observed failure: caller B succeeds silently with stale
    cookies — its retry fetch happens to succeed against the
    unchanged fake jar, masking the missed refresh.

    Post-fix: BOTH callers surface ``RuntimeError`` (the subprocess
    failure is propagated; neither silently skips). The generation
    counter stays at 0 because the subprocess never succeeded —
    subsequent callers will re-attempt the refresh.

    To force the race deterministically in a unit test, we wrap
    ``_get_refresh_lock`` with a barrier so both callers capture
    ``refresh_generation = 0`` BEFORE either enters the inner
    check-and-claim mutex. Without the barrier, asyncio scheduling
    would let A bump generation to 1 before B's pre-lock capture, so
    B would naturally observe gen=1, set its own ``refresh_generation
    = 1``, and the bug would never trigger.

    Narrow race: ``_coalesced_run_refresh_cmd`` exits via ``CancelledError``
    BEFORE the inflight future is registered in
    ``_REFRESH_INFLIGHT_BY_LOOP[loop][refresh_key]``. The caller's
    ``CancelledError`` handler then sees ``inflight is None``, the
    ``if inflight is None or inflight.done():`` branch is taken,
    ``subprocess_exc`` stays ``None``, and pre-fix the code falls through to
    the generation bump even though no subprocess ever ran.

    A concurrent waiter on a different event loop sharing the same
    ``refresh_key`` would observe the phantom generation bump on its
    lock-re-acquire path, treat the storage as freshly-refreshed, skip its
    own ``_run_refresh_cmd``, and proceed with STALE on-disk state.

    We model the race deterministically by patching
    ``_coalesced_run_refresh_cmd`` itself to raise ``CancelledError``
    without touching the registry — equivalent to cancellation landing in
    the sync prefix before the registry insert.

    Post-fix: the cancel-recovery loop tracks ``observed_inflight``;
    ``inflight is None`` keeps it ``False``; the generation bump is gated
    on ``observed_inflight``, so the bump is skipped.

    """Cancel-before-registration with a STALE done future in the registry.

    Warm-registry variant of issue #816. ``_settle`` intentionally leaves
    done futures in the registry (PR #621 cancel/settle race), so after a
    prior successful refresh the registry slot still holds that done
    success future and ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS[refresh_key] = 1``. If
    cancellation arrives before ``_coalesced_run_refresh_cmd`` overwrites
    the slot with a current-attempt future, the caller's ``CancelledError``
    handler reads the registry and finds a NON-NONE entry — but that
    entry is the OLD success future from a previous cycle, not proof of
    the current attempt.

    Pre-fix, ``observed_inflight`` was set to True for any non-None
    registry entry; the cancel-before-register path then attributed the
    prior cycle's success to this caller's no-op attempt and bumped
    ``_REFRESH_GENERATIONS`` from 1 → 2. A concurrent waiter on a sibling
    event loop would observe the phantom bump and skip its own refresh.

    Post-fix, the cancel-recovery loop snapshots ``prior_inflight``
    BEFORE the await and only treats the registry entry as a current
    attempt when either the slot was overwritten (``inflight is not
    prior_inflight``) or the pre-existing entry was active at capture
    (``prior_was_active``). A stale done future fails both predicates,
