"""``make_fake_core`` factory — constructor-injection substrate for sub-clients.

This module provides a single entry point — :func:`make_fake_core` — that
returns a ``FakeSession`` instance shaped to satisfy the **shared
capability Protocols** in :mod:`notebooklm._session_contracts`
(``RpcCaller``, ``LoopGuard``, ``OperationScopeProvider``,
``AsyncWorkRuntime``, ``AuthMetadata``, ``Kernel``) plus the
feature-local runtime Protocols (``ChatRuntime``, ``ArtifactsRuntime``,
``UploadRuntime``) that compose them. Tests pass the result to a
sub-client constructor (``NotebooksAPI(fake)``) instead of constructing
a real ``Session`` and mutating its attributes after the fact.

Phase 7 (refactor.md §Migration Plan step 10) deleted the broad
``Session`` Protocol that this factory's defaults dict previously
mirrored member-for-member. The dict now lists only the attribute slots
features actually exercise — promoting an attribute requires a real
test-site consumer, mirroring the ADR-013 promotion criterion for
shared Protocols.

See :doc:`docs/adr/0007-test-monkeypatch-policy.md` for the policy that
makes this factory the only sanctioned substitute for the forbidden
``monkeypatch.setattr("notebooklm.…")`` and ``core.rpc_call = AsyncMock(…)``
patterns.

Design choices (documented in ADR-007 "Alternatives considered"):

- ``FakeSession`` is a plain class with explicit attribute storage
  (``types.SimpleNamespace``-shaped). It is *not* a spec-based
  ``MagicMock`` because spec-based mocks silently auto-vivify
  attributes and would tie the factory to a single concrete class
  shape rather than the open set of narrow Protocols.
- Async-surface defaults use :class:`unittest.mock.AsyncMock`;
  sync-surface defaults use :class:`unittest.mock.MagicMock`. Both are
  configured with benign return values so a test that only exercises one
  attribute does not have to define the others.
- Overrides are keyword-only — positional arguments would conflict with
  the ``**overrides`` extension point if new attributes are added later.

class FakeSession:
    """A duck-typed stand-in for capability-Protocol collaborators in tests.

    Named ``FakeSession`` for backward compatibility with the broad-
    ``Session``-era test sites; the class itself is just an explicit
    attribute bag and is not pinned to any single Protocol shape.

    Attribute storage is explicit (the constructor only sets what's
    passed in) so that accessing an attribute the production code does
    not actually use surfaces as a clear ``AttributeError`` rather than
    as a silent auto-vivified ``MagicMock``. The canonical schema lives
    in :func:`make_fake_core`'s ``defaults`` dict — one source of truth
    so the schema cannot drift between two declarations.

    Most tests should construct instances via :func:`make_fake_core`,
    which fills in benign defaults; direct construction is also
    supported when a test wants to assert that no defaults are read.
