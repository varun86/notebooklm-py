## [0.5.0] - UNRELEASED

First release on the refactored core. Closes out the Tier 1-8 RPC/VCR
remediation arc, the CLI UX refactor, the arch-disease cleanup, the
v0.3-era deprecation removal cycle, and the multi-phase Session
capability refactor (Phases 1-4 of
`.sisyphus/plans/refactor-completion-plan.md`).

### Phase 4 highlights (Session demolition + capability protocols)

- **Session capability refactor (ADR-013) — feature APIs depend on narrow
  capability protocols** (`RpcCaller`, `OperationScopeProvider`,
  `AsyncWorkRuntime`, `ChatRuntime`, `ArtifactsRuntime`, `UploadRuntime`,
  …) instead of the broad `Session` class.
- **`_core.py` compatibility shim removed.** Use canonical modules
  directly: `_session_config`, `_session_helpers`, `_authed_transport`,
  `_error_injection`, `_transport_drain`, `_auth.storage`,
  `_auth.keepalive`, `notebooklm.rpc`.
- **`_session.py` slimmed** — `MiddlewareChainBuilder` extracted; Session
  compat wrappers around `RpcExecutor` removed in favor of direct
  delegation; 10 non-Protocol setters removed (writes now reach the
  owning collaborator directly).
- **Public `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call` cleaned** — deprecated kwargs
  `_is_retry`, `source_path`, `operation_variant` (removal targets v0.6.0).
- **`NotesAPI.create_from_chat` deprecated** (removal v0.6.0); use
  `ChatAPI.save_answer_as_note`.
- **`docs/architecture.md` added** — post-v0.5.0 collaborator graph and
  capability-protocol model.
- **`docs/deprecations.md` tracker** kept current.

### Phase 4 — breaking changes (none for end users)

All deprecated kwargs and methods emit `DeprecationWarning` and remain
functional through the v0.5.x series; removal targets v0.6.0.

### Phase 4 — internal-only changes

- `notebooklm._core.X` imports no longer resolve (the compatibility
  shim was deleted). Tests and first-party callers must import from
  canonical modules (`_session_config`, `_session_helpers`,
  `_authed_transport`, `_error_injection`, `_transport_drain`,
  `_auth.storage`, `_auth.keepalive`, `notebooklm.rpc`).
- `Session._snapshot`, `Session.update_auth_tokens` now one-line
  delegates; the canonical AST guards live on
  `AuthRefreshCoordinator.{snapshot, update_auth_tokens}` in
  `_session_auth.py` (Phase 3 PR 8).
- 10 of 15 setters on `Session` removed. The 5 retained:
  `_timeout` / `_bound_loop` / `_http_client` / `_refresh_callback`
  (`RpcOwner` / `_AuthedTransportHost` Protocol surface — delegated to
  collaborators); `_reqid_counter` (active `DeprecationWarning` track
  through v0.5.x; removal v0.6.0).
- `@property` pass-through getters on `Session` retained — their
  `_ensure_*()` lazy-init backfill is required by the
  `Session.__new__(Session)` test-fixture pattern.
- `client.NotebookLMClient._core` attribute alias removed (Phase 2
  PR 6); callers must use `client._session`.

---


This release also closes a CLI UX overhaul: a top-to-bottom pass that makes the CLI shell-, CI-, and agent-friendly. The headline changes are uniform `--json` envelopes on every mutating and detail command, an explicit codebase-wide exit-code policy (with two breaking corrections), graceful long-running waits with progress and SIGINT-resume, stdin / env-var / completion conventions across the surface, and the eradication of help-text drift and Python-traceback leaks.

In addition to the CLI UX work, this release rolls up security + concurrency + supply-chain hardening — `--storage` per-file isolation, `notebooklm use` fail-closed verification, `shell=False` default for `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`, single-writer migration under filelock, symlink rejection on `source add`, response-preview truncation, REQUIRED/OPTIONAL cookie-domain split, RPC-override escape hatch, dependency upper bounds + `pip-audit` CI, per-file coverage floors, install-doc block-mirror policy, and `_mind_map` module decoupling. It also rolls up thread-safety and concurrency hardening (`ConnectionLimits` dataclass, `__aexit__` exception arbitration, unique temp file per concurrent download) and a documentation consistency pass (#528–#558).

### Added
- **Inline `__Secure-1PSIDTS` cold-start recovery (`_auth/psidts_recovery.py`).** When `Session.open()` reads a storage file that has `__Secure-1PSID` but no `__Secure-1PSIDTS`, a preflight POST to `accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` proactively mints a fresh `__Secure-1PSIDTS` before any RPC traffic. Cross-process flock (`psidts_recovery.lock`) serializes concurrent cold starts so multiple workers don't fan out duplicate recovery calls. Respects `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1` and env-based auth ([#865](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/865), [#872](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/872)). See [ADR-013 Consequences](docs/adr/0013-composable-session-capabilities.md) for the architectural framing.
- **BREAKING: `NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE` now defaults to `1` (strict mode).** Every call site that descends through the shared `safe_index` helper (the bulk of internal batchexecute decoders) now raises a typed `UnknownRPCMethodError` (subclass of `RPCError`) on shape drift instead of warning and returning `None`, so operators learn about Google-side breakage immediately at the decoder boundary. A small number of legacy positional decoders in `_artifact_downloads`, `_artifact_polling`, and `_chat_protocol` predate `safe_index` and still rely on feature-local error recovery; they are unaffected by this flip and will be migrated in Tier 13.x follow-ups. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0` to opt back into the legacy warn-and-return-`None` behavior for one release window; see `docs/adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md` for the rationale and retirement timeline.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0` soft-mode fallback now emits `DeprecationWarning` when used.** The explicit opt-out still logs the structured `safe_index` drift warning and returns `None`, but each fallback use now also names the decoder `source` in a `DeprecationWarning` so operators can find and migrate remaining consumers before the soft-mode path is removed in v0.6.0.
- **`ADR-011` (Schema validation policy) and `ADR-012` (Implementation surface convention) land.** Decouples the public API surface from internal implementation seams (underscore-prefixed modules) and pins the fail-fast decoder policy.
- **`client.chat.delete_conversation(notebook_id, conversation_id)` + `notebooklm ask --new` is now genuinely destructive.** Captures the web UI's "Delete history" action (`J7Gthc` RPC) so callers can force-end a server-side conversation; the next `ask()` with no `conversation_id` then starts a brand-new one instead of extending the deleted thread (closes the long-standing limitation documented in #659). **⚠ Deleted turns are not recoverable.** The CLI prompts for confirmation with the conversation's short id, defaulting to "No"; pass `--yes`/`-y` to skip, and `--json` implies `--yes` so scripted callers don't hang on stdin. `--new` remains mutually exclusive with `--conversation-id`.
- **`notebooklm ask --new` flag now actually exists.** The flag was promised in the docstring but undeclared; `--new` starts a fresh conversation and is mutually exclusive with `--conversation-id`.
- **`--json` on `artifact get / rename / delete / poll / export`.** Detail commands mirror the underlying dataclasses; mutating commands emit `{"id": ..., "renamed|deleted|exported": true, ...}`. `delete` on a mind-map flags `"kind": "mind_map"`.
- **`--json` on eight `source` subcommands.** `source delete / rename / refresh / clean / get / delete-by-title / add-drive / stale` all accept `--json` and emit structured output. `source stale --json` preserves its inverted exit-code semantics (0 = stale, 1 = fresh) and carries the boolean explicitly via `{"stale": ..., "fresh": ...}`.
- **`--json` on `note get / save / create / delete / rename`.**
- **`--json` on `notebooklm configure` (alias `chat configure`).** Stable shape across both `--mode` and `--persona`/`--response-length` paths.
- **Standard download flag set on `download quiz` and `download flashcards`.** Both commands now expose `--all`, `--latest`, `--earliest`, `--name`, `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--no-clobber`, and `--json` so one wrapper script works across every artifact type.
- **Uniform `--timeout` and `--interval` on long-running ops.** `generate <kind> --wait`, `artifact wait`, and `source wait` now share the same polling-cadence flag surface; pre-existing defaults preserved.
- **`source add` warns when a path-shaped argument doesn't exist.** A typo like `./missin.md` previously fell through to inline-text ingestion silently; now an advisory stderr warning fires before the source is added (still added as text — no breaking exit-code change). Pass `--type text` to suppress.
- **`notebook use --json`.** `use` emits `{"active_notebook_id", "success", "verified", "notebook"}`; `notebook create --use --json` now also surfaces `active_notebook_id`.
- **`--limit` and `--no-truncate` on every `list` command, plus `--no-truncate` on `chat history`.** `notebooklm list`, `source list`, and `artifact list` gain `--limit=N` (client-side slice; reflected in the `--json` `count` field) and `--no-truncate` (table titles wrap instead of ellipsis). `chat history --no-truncate` lifts the hardcoded 50-char preview on Question/Answer columns.
- **Shell completion + ID-aware completers.** New `notebooklm completion <bash|zsh|fish>` prints a Click-generated completion script to stdout. Once sourced, `-n/--notebook`, `-s/--source`, and `-a/--artifact` TAB-complete live IDs from the active profile (capped at 50, best-effort — never trips a traceback in your shell).
- **SIGINT resume hint on long-running `--wait` ops.** Ctrl-C during `generate <kind> --wait`, `artifact wait`, or `source wait` exits 130 with `Cancelled. Resume with: notebooklm artifact poll <task_id>` (or the parallel `source wait <source_id>`) instead of dumping a `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback. Under `--json` the cancellation surfaces as `{"error": true, "code": "CANCELLED", "resume_hint": "..."}`.
- **Unix `-` (stdin) convention on `ask`, `note create`, `source add`, and `--prompt-file`.** `echo "what is X?" | notebooklm ask -`, `cat notes.md | notebooklm note create --content -`, `notebooklm source add -`, and `notebooklm ask --prompt-file -` all read from stdin — matching the `cat`/`tee`/`jq` tradition so pipelines compose without temp files.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK` env var + global `--quiet` flag.** `NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK=<id> notebooklm ask "..."` now works without `-n/--notebook` or a prior `notebooklm use`. `notebooklm --quiet <subcommand>` raises the package logger floor to ERROR for one invocation (mutually exclusive with `-v/-vv`). A new "Env vars and precedence" section in `docs/configuration.md` documents every `NOTEBOOKLM_*` variable in one place.
- **`docs/cli-exit-codes.md` codifies the codebase-wide exit-code policy.** `0` success, `1` user/app error, `2` system/unexpected, `130` SIGINT — citing `cli/error_handler.py` as the canonical implementation and calling out the two intentional exceptions (`source stale` is inverted; `source wait` is three-way).
- **`notebooklm ask --timeout` CLI option (Polish).** Per-invocation HTTP timeout for the `ask` command; matches the existing `source add --timeout` pattern (supersedes #260).
- **Source fulltext markdown format (Polish).** New `output_format="markdown"` on `client.sources.get_fulltext()` and a `-f/--format` CLI flag on `source fulltext` (closes #222). Requires the optional `markdownify` extra (`pip install "notebooklm-py[markdown]"`).
- **Canonical install guide at `docs/installation.md` (Polish).** Single source of truth organised by 6 personas (AI Agent, end user, library user, headless server, contributor, power user), with extras matrix, `[all]` vs `--all-extras` footgun callout, and platform notes. Replaces install instructions previously fragmented across 12+ files.
- **`tests/unit/test_install_docs.py` guardrails (Polish).** 9 automated checks that catch silent drift between `pyproject.toml`, `docs/installation.md`, and the agent-context files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`).
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES` env var for community self-patch.** When Google rotates a `batchexecute` method ID, set e.g. `NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES='{"LIST_NOTEBOOKS": "newId123"}'` and the resolved id is threaded through **both** lookup sites — the `rpcids=` URL query parameter (`_core._build_url`) and the `f.req` request body (`rpc.encoder.encode_rpc_request`) — so the wire never carries mismatched ids. The decoder consumes the same resolved id (the server echoes back whatever was sent). Defense in depth: overrides are gated on the configured base host being on `_env._ALLOWED_BASE_HOSTS` (`notebooklm.google.com` / `accounts.google.com`), so a redirected base can't pivot the overrides. Lets users on a broken release keep working until the next patch ships (#486).
- **`ConnectionLimits` dataclass for httpx pool tuning.** New public `ConnectionLimits(max_connections, max_keepalive_connections, keepalive_expiry)` exposes the connection-pool defaults previously baked into `_core.py`. Pass via `NotebookLMClient(connection_limits=ConnectionLimits(max_connections=200, ...))` (or `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)`) for long-running agents and high-fan-out workers that need to raise the pool ceiling without monkey-patching internals (#527).
- **`--include-domains` flag on `login` / `auth refresh` / `auth inspect`.** The cookie-domain allowlist is now split into `REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` (notebookLM + Drive + the RotateCookies surface — the empirically-justified minimum used by login + token refresh + source-add + chat-ask) and `OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS` (YouTube / Docs / Mail / myaccount — siblings opted into for symmetry with a logged-in browser session). The runtime gate exact-matches REQUIRED only; the back-compat `ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` union is preserved. **User-visible behavior shift:** YouTube cookies are no longer scraped at login or trusted at refresh unless `--include-domains=youtube` (or `=all`) is passed — the other siblings still pass the `.google.com` suffix tier so they're unaffected. Accepts both repeated-flag (`--include-domains=youtube --include-domains=docs`) and comma-separated (`--include-domains=youtube,docs`) syntax; unknown labels raise `click.BadParameter` listing the supported set. A migration note prints on default browser-cookies login pointing at the opt-in (#483).
- **`--follow-symlinks` flag on `source add`.** **Security hardening:** `source add` used to silently follow symlinks during file-source auto-detection, so a workspace symlink like `~/Downloads/foo.pdf → /etc/passwd` would resolve and upload the target with no warning. The path now refuses to traverse symlinks before `Path.resolve()` unless `--follow-symlinks` is explicitly passed; a `ClickException` names the offending path and the opt-in flag (exit 1, no upload attempted). Broken symlinks fall through to the text branch — the contract is that the symlink target is never read as a file (#476).

### Changed
- **`ArtifactDownloadService` takes `storage_path` explicitly** ([#838](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/838), [#888](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/888)). Previously the service captured a snapshot of the session's storage path at construction time, so custom `--storage` overrides applied after construction were silently ignored on download. `ArtifactsAPI` now passes the current `storage_path` to `ArtifactDownloadService` at every download call, so custom storage locations (CLI `--storage` flag, profile switches mid-process) are inherited reliably.
- **`MiddlewareChainBuilder` extracted from `Session.__init__`** ([#883](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/883)). The middleware composition logic that wires the canonical ADR-009 chain (`AuthRefreshMiddleware → SemaphoreMiddleware → RetryMiddleware → MetricsMiddleware → DrainMiddleware → ErrorInjectionMiddleware → TracingMiddleware`) is now a dedicated `_middleware_chain.py` module. `Session.__init__` is correspondingly slimmer; tests can build a chain with arbitrary middleware subsets.
- **`Session._snapshot` / `Session.update_auth_tokens` collapsed to 1-line delegates** ([#884](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/884)). The canonical implementations now live on `AuthRefreshCoordinator` in `_session_auth.py`; the `Session.*` methods are forwarders to satisfy the legacy delegate-surface contract pinned by `tests/unit/test_session_compat_delegates.py`. AST guard infrastructure migrated to the new home.
- **`RPCError.rpc_id` deprecation revoked.** `rpc_id` is now a permanent alias for `method_id`; removing exception diagnostic aliases can mask the original exception inside `except` handlers.
- **`RPCError.code` deprecation revoked.** `code` is now a permanent alias for `rpc_code` for the same exception-handling reason.
- **BREAKING: `source get` / `artifact get` / `note get` exit `1` on not-found (was `0`).** All three `get` commands now exit `1` when the requested ID does not resolve, matching the rest of the CLI's user-error convention so scripts can branch on the exit code without parsing prose. Under `--json` the failure body is the standard `{"error": true, "code": "NOT_FOUND", ...}` envelope; without `--json` the message moves from stdout to stderr. **Migration:** scripts that relied on exit-`0`-on-not-found (e.g. `set -e` probes or `{"found": false}` JSON checks) must switch to `if ! notebooklm source get "$ID"; then ...; fi` or branch on `code: "NOT_FOUND"`.
- **`artifact poll` vs `artifact wait` `--help` clarified on ID kind.** Both `--help` blocks now spell out where each ID typically comes from (`poll <task_id>` straight from `generate`; `wait <artifact_id>` resolved against `artifact list`) and a "Common confusion" callout was added to `docs/cli-reference.md`. Decision recorded: document rather than unify, because the operational difference (one-shot vs blocking, pre- vs post-list-population) is load-bearing for `--wait`-style scripting.
- **BREAKING: `generate cinematic-video --format <non-cinematic>` now exits `2` with a UsageError.** Previously a conflicting `--format mp4`/`explainer`/`brief` was silently overridden to `cinematic`, hiding user intent. The error now matches the existing `--style-prompt cannot be used with cinematic video` rejection. **Migration:** drop the conflicting flag, or use `generate video --format <value>` if a non-cinematic format was actually intended.
- **CLI group docstrings + `docs/cli-reference.md` synced with the live registered subcommand set.** `source`, `download`, `artifact`, and `note` group `--help` blocks now enumerate every registered subcommand (previously missed `add-drive`, `add-research`, `clean`, `wait`, `cinematic-video`, `quiz`, `flashcards`, `suggestions`, `rename`); the reference doc no longer claims unimplemented options. A new `tests/unit/cli/test_help_text.py` snapshot walks every group and fails CI on future drift.
- **`--wait` paths show a transient spinner with elapsed timer.** `generate <kind> --wait`, `artifact wait`, and `source wait` now wrap their blocking poll in a `console.status` spinner with operation kind, an empirical typical-duration hint where one is known (e.g. `typically 30-40 min` for cinematic-video), and a per-second elapsed counter. Spinner is transient and a no-op under `--json` so automation stdout stays pure JSON.
- **Unified `-n/--notebook` help text and consolidated `notebook_option` decorator.** Replaces 53 inline `click.option("-n", "--notebook", ...)` bypass sites across `cli/{artifact,source,note,chat,share,research,generate,notebook,download}.py` with the single canonical decorator, eliminating help-text drift. `helpers.require_notebook` error message now names the user-facing flag (`-n/--notebook`) instead of the internal kwarg (`notebook_id`). A programmatic guardrail asserts every `-n/--notebook` exposure stays consistent.
- **`notebooklm --help` bins five previously-orphaned top-level commands into primary sections.** `auth` joins **Session**; `metadata` joins **Notebooks**; `agent`, `skill`, and `language` join **Command Groups**. The "Other" safety-net bin is now reserved for commands explicitly tagged `category="misc"` — a contract enforced by a new test that fails CI on any future un-binned command.
- **`notebook use` surfaces the typed auth-aware error on expired credentials.** When `client.notebooks.get` raises `AuthError`, `use` now routes through `helpers.handle_auth_error` instead of the generic "Could not verify notebook... Pass --force" catch-all. Text mode shows the canonical "Not logged in" walkthrough with the `notebooklm login` remediation; `--json` emits the standard `AUTH_REQUIRED` envelope. The fail-closed contract and `--force` escape hatch are preserved.
- **`download <type>` exception paths route through the typed error handler.** Every `download` subcommand now wraps the dispatch in `cli.error_handler.handle_errors`. `--json` is honored on the exception path (typed envelope on stdout instead of plain stderr); `RateLimitError.retry_after` surfaces as both a JSON field and a "Retry after Ns" text line; `AuthError` shows the canonical re-auth hint. Exit codes follow the typed policy (1 for library/user errors, 2 for unexpected/system bugs).
- **`notebooklm login` and `notebooklm auth refresh` no longer leak Python tracebacks on unexpected failures.** Both commands now wrap their bodies in `cli/error_handler.py::handle_errors`. Unexpected exceptions become a single friendly line + bug-report URL with exit code `2`; the original traceback remains available at `-vv`. Typed errors (`AuthError`, `NetworkError`, `RateLimitError`, …) keep their dedicated friendly messages.
- **CI `verify-package.yml` extras consolidation (Polish).** `pip install "notebooklm-py[browser,dev]==<version>"` in the source-specific install steps replaces the inline `pip install pytest pytest-asyncio ...` test-deps step, eliminating a major drift surface between `pyproject.toml` `[dev]` and CI.
- **Contributor install canonicalised on `uv sync --frozen` (Polish).** Updated across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/development.md`, `docs/releasing.md`. The previous `uv pip install -e ".[all]"` and `uv sync --all-extras` flows ignored the checked-in `uv.lock`.
- **SKILL.md install command now uses `[browser]` (Polish).** Plus a Python-version-aware optional `[cookies]` install, so AI agents following the skill get the Playwright auth flow out of the box.
- **Cookie identity widened to `(name, domain, path)` per RFC 6265 §5.3 (Polish).** `CookieKey`, `DomainCookieMap`, `AuthTokens.cookies`, `extract_cookies_with_domains`, and `normalize_cookie_map` now key on the path-aware triple. Writes remain backward compatible (flat dicts and legacy 2-tuples still accepted); reads of `auth.cookies` with the old 2-tuple key now raise `KeyError` — use `auth.cookies[("SID", ".google.com", "/")]`, `auth.flat_cookies["SID"]`, or `auth.cookie_header` (#369, #406).
- **`docs/cli-reference.md` final sync against shipped CLI surface.** Verified every section matches `notebooklm <cmd> --help` for the CLI UX overhaul: `--json` documented on every read command, `--limit`/`--no-truncate` on `list` commands and `chat history`, uniform `--timeout`/`--interval`/`--wait` on long-running ops, `--new` on `ask`, `--quiet` on the root group, `-` stdin convention on `ask` / `note create` / `source add` / `--prompt-file`, `completion <bash|zsh|fish>` command + ID-aware completers, and `NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK` env var.
- **BREAKING: `rate_limit_max_retries` default raised from `0` to `3` with exponential-backoff fallback.** `NotebookLMClient(...)`, `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)`, and `ClientCore(...)` now default to `rate_limit_max_retries=3`, so programmatic users inherit smart-retry behavior matching the CLI without having to opt in. Each retry honors `Retry-After` when the server provides a parseable header; when the header is absent or unparseable the loop falls back to capped exponential backoff (`min(2 ** attempt, 30)` seconds with ±20% jitter, mirroring the `server_error_max_retries` path) so the positive default is still useful when Google omits the hint. Mutating create RPCs (`notebooks.create`, `sources.add_url`, `sources.add_youtube`) opt out via `disable_internal_retries=True` — both the 429 and the 5xx/network paths are gated by the same flag, so idempotency safety is preserved. **Migration:** code that relied on a 429 raising `RateLimitError` immediately (e.g. a bespoke back-off layer) should pass `rate_limit_max_retries=0` explicitly. Worst-case cumulative wait under the new default with `Retry-After=MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS (300)` headers is `3 * 300 = 900 s`; without headers the exponential-backoff schedule (1+2+4 ≈ 7s) is dominant.
- **BREAKING: `notebooklm use <id>` fails closed when the notebook doesn't exist.** Previously `use` persisted a typo / network-error / auth-expiry id to `context.json` and quietly continued, leaving every downstream command broken against poisoned saved state. `use` now calls `NotebooksAPI.get(id)` *before* persisting and exits `1` without writing to `context.json` if the notebook resolves to a blank `Notebook(id="", title="")`, raises on the wire, or fails the auth health check. `NotebooksAPI.get` itself is hardened to raise `NotebookNotFoundError` on the parseable-but-empty payload Google returns for unknown IDs (previously it returned a blank `Notebook`). `NotebookNotFoundError` now inherits from **both** `RPCError` and `NotebookError` so existing `except` blocks on either keep working. Pass `--force` to bypass verification (for offline / debugging) — the persisted entry is banner-marked `(not verified — --force)`. **Migration:** scripts that depended on `use` always exiting `0` should now branch on the exit code, or pass `--force` when the IDs are guaranteed valid (#468).
- **`--storage <path>` isolates notebook context per file.** Two `--storage` invocations against different files used to leak notebook state through the default profile's `context.json`. The CLI now derives a sibling context file `<path>.context.json` from `--storage`, with precedence `explicit --storage > profile > legacy home-root`. New `storage_path` keyword on `paths.get_context_path()` / `paths.get_path_info()` plus a thread-through of the `--storage` override from `click.get_current_context().obj` to `_get_context_value` / `_set_context_value` / `set_current_notebook` / `clear_context` / `handle_auth_error`. `status` and `auth logout` use `@click.pass_context` to read the override directly. `status --paths --json` now reports the sibling layout and labels the source as `"CLI flag (--storage)"` (#467).
- **BREAKING: `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` defaults to `shell=False`.** **Security hardening for a shell-injection footgun when the env var is sourced from CI configs or container env files.** `_run_refresh_cmd` now parses the value with `shlex.split` and invokes `subprocess.run(argv, shell=False, ...)`. Empty argv → `RuntimeError("NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD parsed to empty argv")`; malformed quoting → `RuntimeError("... could not be parsed: <ValueError msg>")`. First-token logging uses `os.path.basename(argv[0])` only so absolute secrets-dir paths (e.g. `/home/user/.secrets/refresh.sh`) cannot leak through INFO logs. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL=1` (only the literal string `"1"` opts in — `"0"`/`"false"` stay safe) to keep the prior `shell=True` behavior for cmd strings that rely on shell features (pipes / redirection / `$VAR` expansion); each shell-mode invocation emits `logger.warning("Using shell-mode for NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD (opt-in)")` so the trade-off stays visible. On Windows `shlex.split(cmd, posix=False)` is used so backslash-containing paths produced by `subprocess.list2cmdline` round-trip cleanly. **Migration:** rewrite shell-dependent refresh commands as a single argv (`shlex.join` / `subprocess.list2cmdline`), or opt into the legacy behavior via `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL=1` (#475).
- **`migrate_to_profiles()` serializes under a cross-process filelock.** Two `notebooklm` invocations starting under a fresh home (container start-up races, parallel test runs, MCP worker pools) could both run the copy + delete migration concurrently and leave partial state visible to either. The migration body now acquires `<home>/.migration.lock` and re-checks the `.migration_complete` marker inside the lock; the loser of the race no-ops cleanly. Lock waits past 30 s raise a domain-specific `MigrationLockTimeoutError(RuntimeError)` (the underlying `filelock.Timeout` is preserved as `__cause__`). Legacy-source unlink/rmtree is now tolerant of already-removed paths so a crashed mid-run migration doesn't trip the next runner. Marker re-check reads `default_dir / _MIGRATION_MARKER` (the path where `migration.py` actually writes the marker), not the home root (#478).
- **`RPCError.raw_response` previews capped at 80 chars; `NOTEBOOKLM_DEBUG=1` opts into full body.** Error logs and CLI output used to embed a 500-char verbatim preview of the upstream response — noisy in CI and capable of leaking large server payloads into terminals. The cap is now **80 chars + `"..."`** by default, centralized behind a single `_truncate_response_preview` helper in `exceptions.py` so `RPCError.__init__`, `UnknownRPCMethodError.__init__`, and `decode_response.response_preview` all behave consistently. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_DEBUG=1` to preserve the full untruncated body for deep debugging — only the literal string `"1"` opts in (`"0"`, `"true"`, etc. fall back to truncation, tested as a footgun guard). `UnknownRPCMethodError`'s widened `Any` payload type is preserved — only string payloads are truncated. Documented in `docs/troubleshooting.md` env-var table + "How to get the full response preview" section (#479).

### Removed
- **v0.3-era deprecation cycle complete.** Removed `Source.source_type` (use `Source.kind`), `SourceFulltext.source_type` (use `SourceFulltext.kind`), `Artifact.artifact_type` (use `Artifact.kind`), `Artifact.variant` (use `Artifact.kind`, `.is_quiz`, or `.is_flashcards`), `notebooklm.StudioContentType` (use `ArtifactType`), `notebooklm.DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` (use `notebooklm.paths.get_storage_path()`), and `notebooklm.cli.language.save_config` (use private `_save_config` only inside the CLI module).
- **RPC raw-code `StudioContentType` aliases.** Removed `notebooklm.rpc.types.StudioContentType` and `notebooklm.rpc.StudioContentType`; use `ArtifactType` for public code and `ArtifactTypeCode` only for low-level RPC internals.
- **`RPCMethod.DISCOVER_SOURCES` enum entry.** Unused; no client invocation since pre-0.x. The `qXyaNe` ID was never exercised by any `client.*` API and the rpc-health canary already short-circuited it via `ALWAYS_SKIP_METHODS`. Removed from `rpc/types.py`, `scripts/check_rpc_health.py` (skip list + comment block), `tests/unit/test_rpc_health_coverage.py` (UNAVAILABLE_SKIP_LIST entry; the constant itself is preserved as an empty frozenset for future "exists but not probable" entries), and the Legacy/Unused table in `docs/rpc-reference.md`.

### Deprecated
- **`SourcesAPI.add_file` `mime_type` parameter (Polish).** The `mime_type` argument on `client.sources.add_file()` was never wired into the resumable-upload RPC payload (the server derives MIME from the filename extension). Passing a non-`None` value now emits `DeprecationWarning`; the parameter is scheduled for removal in v0.6.0. Migration: drop the argument; rely on the filename extension. The separate `add_drive(..., mime_type=...)` Drive-source parameter is unaffected.
- **`notebooklm source add --mime-type` on the file-source path (Polish).** The CLI flag is a no-op when the resolved source type is `file`; using it now prints a stderr deprecation note naming v0.6.0 as the removal release (suppress via `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`). The same flag on `notebooklm source add-drive` (Drive sources) is unaffected.
- **`ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion(poll_interval=...)`.** Use `initial_interval=...`; `poll_interval` remains accepted for compatibility and is scheduled for removal in v0.6.0.
- **`NotebooksAPI.share()`.** Use `client.sharing.set_public()` for the canonical notebook-level public-sharing toggle. The wrapper return shape is unchanged in this release and remains scheduled for removal in a future major release.

### Fixed
- **Deep-research source import no longer requires leaving the "Add sources?" modal** ([#315](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/315), [#882](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/882)). The deep-research flow used to discover sources but skip the modal-confirm step, leaving sources in a pending state until a separate UI action committed them. The CLI / `ResearchAPI.import_sources` now commits sources directly. Introduces a `NotebookSourceLister` Protocol in `_notebook_metadata.py` to break the circular dependency between `ResearchAPI` and `SourcesAPI`.
- **`DELETE_NOTE` no longer races shielded `UPDATE_NOTE` at cancel time** ([#876](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/876)). When a `NotesAPI.update(...)` call was in flight and the caller cancelled, the shielded `UPDATE_NOTE` could be followed by `DELETE_NOTE` before the shielded write completed — landing the delete first and then having the update resurrect the note. Cancel-time cleanup is now ordered so `DELETE_NOTE` waits for any shielded `UPDATE_NOTE` to settle.
- **`RPCHealth` surface `httpx` exception class name on empty error messages** ([#874](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/874)). Some `httpx` exception classes raise with empty `str(exc)`, which previously surfaced in CLI output as a blank line. The health check now prefixes the class name (e.g. `ConnectTimeout:` even when the message is empty) so operators can identify the failure mode without reading the full traceback.
- **`notebooklm login` install hint stripped the `[browser]` extra (Polish).** The "Playwright not installed" message rendered as `pip install "notebooklm-py"` (no extras) because Rich interpreted `[browser]` as a style tag. Fixed by passing `markup=False` for the install-command line; the same lines also correct the package name from `notebooklm` to `notebooklm-py`.
- **`__aexit__` exception arbitration + close-leak shield.** `NotebookLMClient.__aexit__` previously masked the original body exception when `aclose()` itself raised, surfacing the close-time error to callers instead. The arbitration now preserves the body exception (chained via `__cause__` where applicable) while still propagating cleanup-time failures, and an inner shield guarantees the underlying httpx client is closed even when intermediate cleanup steps raise. Long-running agents that share a client across many operations no longer lose stack traces from the original failure when shutdown happens to fail too (#526).
- **Unique temp file per concurrent artifact download.** Concurrent `download_*` invocations against the same artifact wrote to a shared `<dest>.tmp` path, so two parallel callers could clobber each other's bytes mid-stream and one would see a corrupted file. Each invocation now allocates a unique temp file (PID + uuid suffix) and atomically renames into the final destination, preventing concurrent-conflict corruption when an `asyncio.gather` fans out over the same artifact (#523).
- **`add_file` TOCTOU close + `max_concurrent_uploads` knob.** `SourcesAPI.add_file` used to open the source file twice — once implicitly for `stat()`-based size probing, again inside `_upload_file_streaming` — and a path swap between those two moments could substitute a different file into a successful upload. The file is now opened once during validation; the FD is held across the size check (`os.fstat(fd.fileno())`), source registration, upload-session start, and the streamed POST body, with `try`/`with` guaranteeing release on every exit path (including `CancelledError`). A new `max_concurrent_uploads: int | None = 4` knob on `NotebookLMClient` and `from_storage()` caps the simultaneous in-flight uploads; each in-flight upload holds one open file descriptor for its duration, so the cap doubles as an FD-exhaustion guard against fan-out callers (`asyncio.gather` over 100 `add_file` calls now holds at most 4 FDs at a time instead of 100). The semaphore is per-instance and independent of the RPC connection pool because uploads use their own `httpx.AsyncClient` against the Scotty endpoint. `None` resolves to the default — unbounded uploads are intentionally rejected (`max_concurrent_uploads=0`/`<0` raises `ValueError` at construction).
- **Research `task_id` cross-wire on concurrent in-flight tasks.** When two research sessions were in flight on the same notebook (e.g. a deep-research task followed by a fast-research follow-up before the first completed), `ResearchAPI.poll(notebook_id)` silently returned the latest task — so a caller that started task A could unknowingly receive results for task B, and an `import_sources(..., task_id="A", sources=<discovered under B>)` would mis-attribute provenance. Two non-breaking guards land together. `poll()` gains an optional `task_id: str | None = None` discriminator; when supplied, the parsed-tasks list is filtered to that id; when `None` AND multiple tasks are in flight (the actually-broken case), a `DeprecationWarning` fires citing the migration path — old behavior is preserved on a single in-flight task (no warning) and on multi-task back-compat (warn + return latest). `import_sources()` adds a per-source check that raises the new `ResearchTaskMismatchError` (subclass of `ValidationError`) when a `research_task_id` on any source disagrees with the caller's `task_id`, before any RPC traffic is issued. The `research wait` CLI pins to the discovered task_id on subsequent poll iterations so a concurrent caller can't substitute a different task's results into the wait loop. The `None` default on `poll(task_id=None)` is scheduled for removal in a future major release.

### Infrastructure
- **Session delegate-surface regression guard** ([#885](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/885)). New `tests/unit/test_session_compat_delegates.py` uses `ast` to parse `Session.{_build_url, _await_refresh, _rpc_call_impl, _raise_rpc_error_from_http_status, _raise_rpc_error_from_request_error, _try_refresh_and_retry, _snapshot, update_auth_tokens}` and enforce that each remains a 1-3-statement delegate forward to its owning collaborator (`RpcExecutor` for six methods, `AuthRefreshCoordinator` for two). Any future refactor that inlines logic back into `Session` fails this guard at CI time, protecting the composable-capabilities invariant established by ADR-013.
- **`cli/services/` subpackage extraction** (ADR-008). Click command handlers across `cli/{generate,source,session}.py` had grown to mix business logic with Click's argument-parsing concerns, making them hard to test without spinning up the CLI runner. Service-layer extraction pulled the pure-logic paths into `cli/services/{artifact_generation, login, source_add, source_clean}.py`; Click handlers now own argument parsing + I/O envelopes and delegate to the service modules. See `docs/adr/0008-cli-services-extraction-pattern.md` for the rationale and pattern.
- **`tests/integration/` tier-enforcement collection hook.** New `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook in `tests/integration/conftest.py` raises `pytest.UsageError` at collection time when a test under `tests/integration/` lacks all three of: `@pytest.mark.vcr`, `@notebooklm_vcr.use_cassette(...)` (detected by walking the `wrapt.FunctionWrapper` chain for the VCR `CassetteContextDecorator`), or the explicit `@pytest.mark.allow_no_vcr` opt-out. The opt-out marker is registered once in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options].markers` and applied at module level to the existing mock-only files that live under `tests/integration/` for tree-organization reasons (`test_skill_packaging.py`, `test_core.py`, `test_auto_refresh.py`, `test_artifacts_drift.py`, `test_get_summary_drift.py`, `test_download_multi_artifact.py`, and the `concurrency/test_*` subtree). New mock-only tests should land in `tests/unit/`; `allow_no_vcr` is a transitional escape hatch, not a default. A pytester-based regression test (`tests/unit/test_tier_enforcement_hook.py`) pins the hook's behavior with a committed, durable assertion — including the `use_cassette` wrapper-introspection branch — so weakening the hook fails CI.
- **`ArtifactsAPI` ↔ `NotesAPI` decoupled via `_mind_map` module.** Mind-map RPC primitives (`list_mind_maps`, `create_note`, `update_note`, `fetch_all_notes_and_mind_maps`) moved to a new `_mind_map` module that both `ArtifactsAPI` and `NotesAPI` import directly. `ArtifactsAPI.__init__` no longer requires `notes_api=client.notes`, which removes the load-bearing init order in `NotebookLMClient`. The `notes_api` keyword is retained as an optional, ignored argument for backward compatibility with existing callers. `NotesAPI` keeps its public surface — including the `_is_deleted` / `_extract_content` / `_parse_note` private helpers used by unit tests — by delegating to the shared module. New `tests/unit/test_init_order.py` pins init-order-agnostic construction plus mind-map regression coverage for `generate_mind_map` / `list` / `download_mind_map` (#489).
- **Dependency upper bounds + `pip-audit` CI workflow.** Every entry in `[project.dependencies]` and each `[project.optional-dependencies]` extra now carries an upper bound — pre-1.0 packages (httpx) cap on the next minor; 1.x+ packages cap on the next major. Bounds are conservative enough to leave headroom for transitive resolution but tight enough that a breaking new major can't quietly land in CI. New `.github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml` runs `pip-audit --strict` against the locked env on push to `main`, on every PR that touches the manifest, and nightly. Soft-launched with `continue-on-error: true` for the first release cycle so a transient advisory database hiccup doesn't block merges; flipping to hard-fail is a one-line follow-up (#490).
- **Per-file coverage floor enforcement.** `coverage.py`'s `[tool.coverage.report]` only supports a global `fail_under`, so individual files that have always lagged the project-wide 90% used to silently regress whenever a refactor touched them — the global gate stayed green because the strong files compensated. `scripts/check_coverage_thresholds.py` now reads `[tool.notebooklm.per_file_coverage_floors]` from `pyproject.toml` and fails CI when individual files drop below their listed floor, in addition to the global gate. Floors are set ~2% below the current measured coverage for four named files (`cli/_firefox_containers.py`, `cli/doctor.py`, `cli/profile.py`, `cli/session.py`) so transient flakes don't trip CI on unrelated PRs. `__main__.py` floor is `0` (CLI entry isn't unit-tested) so it's an explicit "we know it's uncovered" rather than a silent gap (#491).
- **`docs/installation.md` ↔ `CONTRIBUTING.md` block-mirror enforcement.** `scripts/check_ci_install_parity.py` already enforced the canonical install command across both files; it now also enforces a block-mirror policy: every fenced ` ```bash ` block in `installation.md` must EITHER appear verbatim in `CONTRIBUTING.md` OR be marked `<!-- not mirrored: <reason> -->` on the line directly before its opening fence. Forces each install-doc edit to consciously decide whether the new block belongs in the contributor-mirrored subset — silent drift becomes a CI failure with the missing/unmarked block named. New `--installation` flag points at the source of truth so the script is parametric (#492).

### Documentation
- **Documentation consistency pass (#528–#558).** A 17-PR run sweeping the docs tree: breaking-example fixes in `docs/python-api.md` (#547) and `docs/cli-reference.md` (#537, #545); `__all__` ↔ `__init__.py` parity in `docs/stability.md` (#531); `docs/installation.md` filelock dep + login flow + timestamp fixes (#529); `docs/configuration.md` profile/language + env-var table backfill (#539); `docs/troubleshooting.md` auth-error text + cookie dedup (#532); `docs/development.md` test-tree + concurrency model + cross-links (#538); `docs/releasing.md` pre-release scripts (#534); `docs/rpc-development.md` non-transient ERROR triage (#535); `docs/rpc-reference.md` `SHARE_ARTIFACT` shape + tier strings (#534); `docs/auth-keepalive.md` cookie-domain split coverage (#540); CLI-reference flag backfill for `--storage`, conversation flags, and `--include-domains` (#537, #545); `docs/python-api.md` consistency pass (#558); `docs/cli-reference.md` consistency pass (#557); README slim with `docs/installation.md` cross-link (#533); CONTRIBUTING ↔ `docs/development.md` cross-link (#528). No source-code changes.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-11

> **Compatibility note.** Despite a few additive items (`notebooklm auth refresh` CLI, `keepalive=` constructor argument on `NotebookLMClient`, `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` env var, two new dataclass fields), 0.4.1 is shipped as a patch release because the dominant work — and the reason to ship now — is auth/cookie stability remediation. Bumping to v0.5.0 would force the long-deferred removal of v0.3-era deprecated APIs (see [Stability](docs/stability.md)) earlier than scheduled; we'd rather keep that change isolated from the auth-keepalive work. All additive items are backward compatible — existing code keeps working without changes.

### Added
- **`notebooklm auth refresh` CLI command** - One-shot keepalive that opens a session, triggers the layer-1 SIDTS rotation poke against `accounts.google.com`, persists the rotated cookies to `storage_state.json`, and exits. Designed to be scheduled by the OS (launchd / systemd / cron / Task Scheduler / k8s CronJob) to keep an idle profile from staling out between user-driven calls. Pairs naturally with `--quiet` for log-only-on-error cron output. Requires file/profile-backed authentication — explicitly refuses to run when `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` is set (no writable backing store). See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for per-OS scheduler recipes (#336).
- **Periodic keepalive task on `NotebookLMClient`** - Long-lived clients (agents, workers, multi-hour `async with` blocks) can opt into a background task that periodically POSTs `RotateCookies` to drive `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation, then persists rotated cookies to `storage_state.json` immediately so a crash doesn't lose the freshness. Disabled by default — pass `keepalive=<seconds>` to `NotebookLMClient(...)` or `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` to enable. Values below `keepalive_min_interval` (default 60 s) are clamped up to that floor. The loop swallows transient errors at DEBUG and continues; cancellation on `__aexit__` is clean. Persistence runs off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread` so the loop never blocks on disk I/O. Closes the gap left by the per-call layer-1 poke for clients that never re-call `fetch_tokens` (#297, #312, #341).
- **Auto-refresh on auth expiry** - `fetch_tokens` now optionally runs a user-provided shell command when a Google session cookie has expired, reloads cookies from the same storage path, and retries once. Opt in by setting the `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` environment variable to a command that rewrites `storage_state.json` (e.g. a sync script reading from a cookie vault). Refresh commands receive `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH` and `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE` so profile-aware scripts can target the active auth file. Covers every CLI entry point without changing the public API. Retry guards prevent refresh loops (#336).
- **`examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py`** - Sample `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` script that re-extracts cookies from a live local browser via `notebooklm login --browser-cookies`. Provides a recovery path for unattended automation when the in-process keepalive isn't enough (idle gaps, force-logout, password change).
- **`Source.created_at` and `GenerationStatus.url` public dataclass fields** - `Source.created_at` is now populated for both nested and deeply-nested response paths. `GenerationStatus.url` is now populated by `poll_status` for media artifact types (audio, video, infographic, slide-deck PDF) so callers can stream the asset as soon as the status flips to ready (#349, #356).
- **`ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` extended for sibling Google products** - The browser-cookie import path now accepts cookies from Google's sibling product domains, restoring `--browser-cookies` flows for users whose active Google session lives on a sibling surface rather than `notebooklm.google.com` directly (#362).

### Fixed
- **Cookies could silently stale out under sustained use** - `fetch_tokens` now POSTs to `https://accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` (Chrome's dedicated unsigned rotation endpoint) before hitting `notebooklm.google.com` to drive `__Secure-1PSIDTS` / `__Secure-3PSIDTS` rotation. Empirically validated against both DBSC-bound (Playwright-minted) and unbound (Firefox-imported) profiles. RPC traffic against `notebooklm.google.com` alone does not appear to trigger rotation, so a keepalive that hit NotebookLM alone could silently stale out. The rotated `Set-Cookie` lands in the live `httpx` jar and is persisted via `save_cookies_to_storage()` along the `fetch_tokens_with_domains` / `AuthTokens.from_storage` paths. A 60 s mtime guard rate-limits the layer-1 poke — the POST is skipped when storage was recently rotated. Failures log at DEBUG and never abort token fetch. Disable with `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1` (e.g. networks that block `accounts.google.com`). Closes #312 (#345, #346).
- **Concurrent `RotateCookies` poke stampede** - The 60 s mtime guard only debounces *sequential* invocations; under `asyncio.gather` fan-out, parallel CLI loops, or MCP worker pools, all callers see the same stale `storage_state.json` mtime and stampede the POST. Three layered protections inside `_poke_session`: a per-event-loop, per-storage-path async lock registry plus a sync state lock for in-process dedup (an `asyncio.gather` of 10 fires exactly one POST), a non-blocking `LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB` flock on the new `.storage_state.json.rotate.lock` sentinel for cross-process dedup (parallel CLI loops / MCP workers skip silently when another process is rotating), and a failure-stampede protection where the timestamp updates regardless of POST outcome — so a 15 s timeout against a hung `accounts.google.com` doesn't let 10 fanned-out callers each wait the full timeout. The layer-2 keepalive loop now calls the bare `_rotate_cookies` directly (it's already self-paced via `keepalive_min_interval`) and `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE` continues to disable both layers (#347, #348).
- **`Notebook.sources_count` parsed but never surfaced** - The `sources_count` field on the public `Notebook` dataclass is now populated from `data[1]` on both LIST and GET notebook shapes; previously it always read as `0` regardless of actual source count (#350).
- **`Artifact.url` unpopulated for media artifacts** - The `url` field on the public `Artifact` dataclass is now populated for media types (audio, video, infographic; slide-deck exposes the PDF URL — use `download_slide_deck(output_format="pptx")` for PPTX) so callers no longer need to drop down to `download_*` to obtain the asset URL (#349, #356).
- **Cross-process and refresh-path save races** - Close lifecycle and refresh-path saves now serialize correctly with the keepalive writer; concurrent writers no longer overwrite each other's rotated cookies (#344).
- **Keepalive ↔ close serialization; stop mutating caller `Auth`** - The keepalive task no longer races with `__aexit__`, and no longer mutates the `Auth` instance the caller passed in. Callers that share an `Auth` across multiple clients now get the isolation the API documented (#343).
- **Snapshot keepalive cookie jar; normalize explicit `storage_path`** - The keepalive task now snapshots the live `httpx` jar before writing (avoiding torn writes when an RPC is mid-flight); an explicit `storage_path=` argument to `NotebookLMClient` is normalized onto the `Auth` instance so the keepalive task writes to the file the caller actually pointed at (#342).
- **Per-domain cookie scoping on file upload** - File-upload requests now send only cookies whose `Domain` attribute applies to the upload host, instead of the full jar. Prevents upload rejection when the jar mixes cookies for `google.com`, `notebooklm.google.com`, and `googleusercontent.com` (#373, #374).
- **Two-tier cookie validation pre-flight** - Auth loaders now distinguish "missing-but-recoverable" from "fatal" cookie states before attempting an RPC, surfacing clearer errors and avoiding doomed requests against Google's identity surface (#372).
- **Preserve cookie attributes on load** - `Domain`, `Path`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes round-trip through storage load, restoring behaviors that depended on cross-host scoping (#365, #368).
- **Unify flat-cookie selection across loaders** - Legacy flat-cookie and modern Playwright storage shapes now share a single selection contract; subtle mismatches between the two paths are eliminated (#375, #376).
- **Tolerate non-numeric / out-of-range timestamp values on dataclasses** - `Notebook.created_at`, `Source.created_at`, and `Artifact.created_at` now catch `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `OSError`, and `OverflowError` from `datetime.fromtimestamp` and resolve to `None` instead of raising on edge-case server responses (#357).
- **`examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py` `--profile` placement** - The example invoked `... login --browser-cookies <b> --profile <p>` but `--profile` is a top-level Click option and was rejected after `login` (`Error: No such option: --profile`). Now invokes `... --profile <p> login --browser-cookies <b>` and works end-to-end against profile-backed storage.

### Infrastructure
- **Consolidated URL extraction** - `_extract_artifact_url`, per-type extractors (audio/video/infographic/slide-deck), and `_is_valid_artifact_url` moved to `types.py`. Readiness checks, `Artifact.url`, `GenerationStatus.url`, and the download paths now share one URL-selection contract: `mp4` quality-4 > any `mp4` > first valid URL for video. `SourcesAPI.get_fulltext` fixed for YouTube fulltext URLs at `metadata[5][0]` along the way (#349, #356).
- **Removed redundant `ArtifactsAPI` URL helpers** - Private `_is_valid_media_url` and `_find_infographic_url` shim methods removed; tests now exercise the canonical `types.py` helpers (#358).
- **E2E `--profile` pytest flag** - `pytest --profile <name>` scopes the E2E notebook ID cache to a named profile, so parallel multi-profile test runs don't collide on the cached notebook fixture (#340).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Multi-account profiles** - Switch between Google accounts without re-authenticating (#227)
  - `notebooklm profile create/list/switch/rename/delete` commands
  - Global `--profile` / `-p` flag and `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` environment variable to scope any command to a profile
  - Per-profile storage paths under `~/.notebooklm/profiles/<name>/`
  - Implicit default profile preserved for backward compatibility; existing `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json` is auto-detected as the default profile (no manual migration needed)
- **`notebooklm doctor` diagnostic command** - `notebooklm doctor [--fix] [--json]` checks profile setup, auth, and migration status; reports actionable issues
- **Microsoft Edge SSO login** - `notebooklm login --browser msedge` for organizations that require Edge for SSO (#204)
- **Browser cookie import** - Reuse cookies from your existing browser session without driving Playwright
  - `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>` (chrome, edge, firefox, safari, etc.)
  - New `convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state()` Python helper
  - Optional `[cookies]` extra installs `rookiepy` (`pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`)
  - Honors the active profile: `notebooklm --profile <name> login --browser-cookies <browser>` writes to that profile's `storage_state.json`. Note that cookie extraction always pulls the source browser's currently-active Google account for `google.com` / `notebooklm.google.com` — to populate multiple profiles from the same browser, switch the active Google account in the browser between runs (or use a separate browser per profile).
- **EPUB source type** - Upload `.epub` files as notebook sources (#231)
- **Agent skill installation** - Install the bundled NotebookLM skill into local AI agents (#206, #207)
  - `notebooklm skill install` - Install into `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm` and `~/.agents/skills/notebooklm`
  - `notebooklm skill status` - Check installation state
  - `notebooklm agent show codex` / `notebooklm agent show claude` - Print bundled agent templates
- **Mind map customization** - `client.artifacts.generate_mind_map()` now accepts `language` and `instructions` parameters (#252)
- **`note list --json`** - Machine-readable note listings (#259)
- **Bare status codes in decoder errors** - Decoder surfaces server status codes on null RPC results for clearer diagnostics (#114, #294)

### Fixed
- **Cross-domain cookie preservation** - Login storage state retains cookies across `google.com` and `notebooklm.google.com` subdomains, restoring sessions for regional domains
- **NotebookLM subdomain cookies** - Subdomain cookies are no longer dropped during login (#334)
- **Video artifact detection** - Correctly detect completed video media URLs in polling responses (#333)
- **Research import on unavailable snapshots** - CLI gracefully handles missing source snapshots during research import (#335)
- **Source import retry** - Filtered partial-import retry payloads and tightened verification to avoid false positives (#321, #327)
- **Server-state verification on timeout** - Prevents duplicate inflation when source imports time out (#319)
- **Playwright navigation interruption** - Handles updated Playwright behavior on already-authenticated sessions (#214, #322)
- **Login subprocess on Windows** - Use `sys.executable` for Playwright subprocess calls (#279)
- **Legacy Windows Unicode output** - Sanitized output streams for legacy Windows consoles (#324)
- **Settings quota errors** - Use account limits when reporting create-quota failures (#328)
- **Chat references** - Emit references only from the winning chunk to avoid >600-element duplication (#300, #310)
- **Login retry mechanism** - Resolved race conditions and improved error handling on retry (#243)
- **Quota detection during polling** - Detect quota / daily-limit failures during artifact polling (#240)
- **Google account switching** - Fixed switching between Google accounts at login time (#246)
- **YouTube URL extraction** - Extract YouTube URLs at deeply-nested response positions (#265)
- **Bare-HTTP URL fallback** - Disabled brittle bare-HTTP fallback in `sources.list()` (#294)
- **Logout context cleanup** - Clear the active notebook context on `notebooklm logout`
- **Infographic URL extraction** - Aligned with download-path logic; added regression test (#229)
- **Custom storage path for downloads** - Artifact downloads now respect custom auth storage paths (#235)
- **Windows file permissions** - Skip Unix-only `0o600` calls on Windows and rely on Python 3.13+ ACL behavior (#225)
- **TOCTOU protection** - Hardened directory creation in `session.py` (#225)

### Changed
- **`rookiepy` is an optional `[cookies]` extra** - Excluded from `[all]` to avoid Python 3.13+ install issues; install with `pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`
- **Login error detection** - Improved detection of missing browser binaries (e.g., `msedge` not installed)
- **Skill installation paths** - Hardened to handle alternative `~/.claude` and `~/.agents` layouts
- **Deprecation removal deferred to v0.5.0** - The deprecated APIs originally scheduled for removal in v0.4.0 — `StudioContentType`, `Source.source_type`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type`, `Artifact.variant`, and `DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` — continue to work and emit `DeprecationWarning`. Removal is now planned for v0.5.0 to give downstream users an extra release to migrate.

### Infrastructure
- Pinned `ruff==0.8.6` in dev deps to match pre-commit configuration
- Bumped `python-dotenv` (#299)
- Bumped `pytest` in the `uv` group
- Added contribution templates and PR quality guidelines for issues and PRs

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-12

### ⚠️ Beta Release Notice

This is the initial public release of `notebooklm-py`. While core functionality is tested and working, please note:

- **RPC Protocol Fragility**: This library uses undocumented Google APIs. Method IDs can change without notice, potentially breaking functionality. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for debugging guidance.
- **Unofficial Status**: This is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
- **API Stability**: The Python API may change in future releases as we refine the interface.

### Known Issues

- **RPC method IDs may change**: Google can update their internal APIs at any time, breaking this library. Check the [RPC Development Guide](docs/rpc-development.md) for how to identify and update method IDs.
- **Rate limiting**: Heavy usage may trigger Google's rate limits. Add delays between bulk operations.
- **Authentication expiry**: CSRF tokens expire after some time. Re-run `notebooklm login` if you encounter auth errors.
- **Large file uploads**: Files over 50MB may fail or timeout. Split large documents if needed.
